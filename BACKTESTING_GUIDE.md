## ðŸš€ How to Use Backtesting

### **Method 1: Simple Backtest**
```bash
python simple_backtest.py
```

**What it does:**
- Tests basic moving average crossover strategy
- Uses AAPL data from 2023-2024
- Shows total return and trade signals

### **Method 2: Advanced Multi-Agent Backtest**
```bash
python multi_agent_backtest.py
```

**What it does:**
- Tests multiple technical strategies simultaneously
- Generates comprehensive performance metrics
- Creates detailed charts and visualizations
- Simulates the full multi-agent workflow

### **Method 3: Custom Backtest**
```python
from multi_agent_backtest import MultiAgentBacktester

# Initialize backtester
backtester = MultiAgentBacktester()

# Run custom backtest
result = await backtester.run_backtest(
    symbol="GOOGL",
    start_date="2023-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-01",
    initial_capital=100000
)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Backtesting Results Explained

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Total Return**: Overall percentage gain/loss
- **Annualized Return**: Return adjusted for time period
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Total Trades**: Number of buy/sell transactions

### **Example Results**
```
Backtest Results for AAPL:
Total Return: -0.09%
Final Value: $99,911.26
Data Points: 65
Number of signals: 16
```

## ðŸ”§ Customizing Your Backtest

### **1. Change Symbols**
```python
# Test different stocks
symbols = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "TSLA", "NVDA"]
for symbol in symbols:
    result = await backtester.run_backtest(symbol, "2023-01-01", "2024-01-01")
```

### **2. Adjust Time Periods**
```python
# Test different time periods
periods = [
    ("2022-01-01", "2023-01-01"),  # 2022
    ("2023-01-01", "2024-01-01"),  # 2023
    ("2024-01-01", "2025-01-01"),  # 2024
]
```

### **3. Modify Strategy Parameters**
```python
# Adjust technical indicators
df['SMA_20'] = df['Close'].rolling(20).mean()  # Change window
df['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(df['Close'], 14)    # Change RSI period
```

### **4. Risk Management Settings**
```python
# Adjust position sizing and risk
position_size = 0.1      # 10% of portfolio per trade
stop_loss = 0.02         # 2% stop loss
take_profit = 0.04       # 4% take profit
```

### **2. Avoid Overfitting**
- Don't optimize parameters too much
- Test on out-of-sample data
- Use walk-forward analysis

### **3. Consider Transaction Costs**

- Account for slippage
- Factor in bid-ask spreads

### **4. Test Multiple Scenarios**
- Different market conditions
- Various volatility periods
- Multiple asset classes

## ðŸ”„ From Backtesting to Live Trading

### **Step 1: Validate Strategy**
```bash
# Run comprehensive backtest
python multi_agent_backtest.py
```

### **Step 2: Paper Trading**
```bash
# Test with live data (paper trading)
python simple_demo.py
```

### **Step 3: Live Trading**
```bash
# Deploy to production
python multi_agent_trading_system.py --mode live --symbols AAPL GOOGL
```
