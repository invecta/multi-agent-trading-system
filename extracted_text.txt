\n--- Page 3 ---\nDear reader, Thank you for downloading this book on Goldbach trading. We hope that you will ﬁnd value in the information and insights contained within these pages. The book originated as my view on what a famous mentor on the internet was trying to communicate, but it’s good to mention this is my view - and my view only. The book maps price action seen in diﬀerent trading assets (such as currencies, metals, indices, …) using mathematical concepts. By no means this book claims to solve enigma, imp, or any other buzz word you ﬁnd ﬂying around on the internet. Like ict says, we can explore the wonderful world of Goldbach and Power of Three, but any match to ict concepts is pure coincidence.

\n--- Page 4 ---\nThe fundamental book you’re reading now will focus on just the basics: 
Explain the power of three (PO3) and why it’s an important number to determine dealing ranges 
Explain what Goldbach is, and why they are important levels inside dealing ranges Both the PO3 number and the Goldbach levels inside them make up your price levels. As you read through this book, we hope that you will come to understand and appreciate the signiﬁcance of power of three numbers, and learn how to use them to your advantage, using PO3 dealing ranges.  We believe that using power of three in your trade arsenal will be a valuable tool for you. We will also delve into what we call the Goldbach levels, how it relates to interesting areas where trades will form, and why the number 6 plays a crucial role here. Last but not least, we will unlock the secrets of the Goldbach look back period, where the number 9 will play a prominent role. We will discuss the look back partitions base on the number 9, which is more of a broader or longer term if you will view on the market. FundamentalsPage  of 4195 2025.03

\n--- Page 17 ---\nINTRODUCTION TO PO3 The power of three numbers is a concept that has fascinated people for centuries. These numbers, often referred to as "triplet numbers," are said to hold a special power and signiﬁcance, and have been revered by many cultures throughout history. But what are these mysterious numbers, and how can we use them to unlock the secrets of the universe? We will learn how to calculate and understand these special numbers. First, let's start with a brief history of the power of three. The concept of triplet numbers can be traced back to ancient civilisations, where they were often associated with spiritual or religious signiﬁcance. In many cultures, three was seen as a perfect number, representing balance and harmony. The power of three was also prevalent in the mythology of many ancient cultures. In Greek mythology, the number three was associated with the goddess of wisdom, Athena, and the god of war, Ares. In Hindu mythology, the number three was considered sacred and represented the three worlds of creation, preservation, and destruction. But the power of three is not just limited to ancient history and mythology. In modern times, the concept of triplet numbers continues to be revered and studied by people all over the world. From mathematics and science to art and literature, the power of three can be found in many diﬀerent ﬁelds. FundamentalsPage  of 17195 2025.03

\n--- Page 19 ---\nCALCULATING POWERS OF THREE In mathematics, a power of three is a number of the form 3n where n is an integer – that is, the result of exponentiation with number three as the base and integer n as the exponent. You can also calculate the result multiplying the number 3 x times.  3 x 3 = 9The result, 9, is the power of three for the integer 2, or written as 32  We can continue this process for any number we choose. For example, the powers of three for the integer 5 would be: 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 243In excel, a powers of the number three is calculated using the following formula: power(3, integer)Depending on your asset, the powers of three result you get from your calculation is either expressed in pips or in points.  For example, a ﬁxed dealing range for foreign exchange asset (fx) EURUSD might be 243 pips (35), while a Nasdaq futures symbol is expressed in points, for example 81 (34) points.

\n--- Page 22 ---\nWHAT IS GOLDBACH Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. 2So how does Goldbach come into play in our day to day trading? We go with the premise that price will be inside a pre deﬁned dealing range. This dealing range will be 100%. The number 100 is just the percentage of a range. A full range is 100%, hence the number 100. A Goldbach partition are 2 primes that when added them together give the result of 100. For example, 1 Goldbach partition is the number 3 and it’s counterpart number 97. 3 + 97 = 100. An even number can have more than 1 Goldbach partition. For the even number 100 we can determine 7 Goldbach partitions. We can use a goldbach calculator to ﬁnd all pairs for a given number for us.  Source: wikipedia2FundamentalsPage  of 22195 2025.03

\n--- Page 24 ---\nWhen we represent the Goldbach partitions inside a table format, we end up with following table: 
You can see that for each partition, the discount number and the premium number add up to the number 100.  These partitions also explain market symmetry. The low number together with the high number (for example 11 and 89) are symmetrical opposed to each other. Because we go with the assumption that a dealing range is expressed in percentage (%), each step from 1 prime number to the next prime number, for example a move from a discount prime number 11 to the next prime number 17 is also expressed in percentage. Apart from the second partition - which jumps with 8 percent (from 3 > 11 = 8, as is the move from 97 -> 89) - you will see that most partitions are 6 percent apart from each other, where the 5th and 6th partition will jump 12 steps at once. The partitions that are 12 percent will be divided in 2 as well, so they form 2 partitions of 6 percent too. The middle of this PartitionDiscountPremium1010023973118941783529716415974753

\n--- Page 25 ---\n12% block, divided in 2 will also a an interesting level, and because they are no price number per se, I call the non Goldbach levels. But even these non Goldbach numbers have interesting characteristics. The non Goldbach numbers are 23-77 and 35-65. Now 23, is a prime number itself. 35, 65 and 77 are not. But they are semi primes.  35 can be expressed as 5 x 7, both primes 65 can be expressed as 5 x 13, both primes 77 can be expressed as 7 x 11, both primes. So although they are not part of the Goldbach partitions, they provide interesting levels too in our trading range. An interesting fact is that, when you stack two 100% ranges on top of each other, you will see that the partition 1 of the current dealing range - which is 3 percent (from 0 > 3 or from 100 -> 97) - combined together with partition 1 of the next dealing range (be it a full 100% range below or above the current range) - which is also 3 percent - will also create a “block” of 6 percent. So now we already have number 3 for the power of three ranges and make up our dealing ranges, and number 6 which separates the Goldbach partitions. This is the real rejection block.

You will also notice that the array where the liquidity void is (the 29/71 Goldbach partition), the levels are 12% apart. This is the nature of a liquidity void, as this is where there is most of the time a large one direction move, which is what we expect due to the 12%. To map the levels to ICT’s concept, like rejection block, order block, we take the value of the level just below it until the current value.  So for a rejection block, we take 0 -> 3 or 100 -> 97, for an order block we take 97 -> 89 or 3 -> 11 and so on.

\n--- Page 31 ---\nMIDDLE OF GOLDBACH BLOCKS A Goldbach block is the area in between 2 consecutive Goldbach levels. For example the area in between level 11 and level 17 is a Goldbach block. As a refresher, each Goldbach block is typically 6% of a range, the second block is 8% (from 3 -> 11 or 97 -> 89). And we have the 12% blocks, which are basically 2 6% blocks separated by the non Goldbach level. But each Goldbach block can be divided in 2 separate areas too (a discount and premium area) as well, and those levels will be sensitive support and resistance areas too. In the next screenshot you will see how the Goldbach levels (full lines), the non Goldbach levels (dashed lines) and the middle block levels (dotted lines) act as support and resistance.

\n--- Page 32 ---\nFurther evidence ICT is using Goldbach can be found using following methodology. You will hear him speak about inversion a lot of times. Like an inverse fair value gap, an inverse (failed) order block will become a mitigation block or a breaker, and so on. Now where does this come from you say? As we’re using Goldbach, we’re also going to inverse the numbers, and skip the extremes of the range, so skip 0 and 100. But we will take the non Goldbach numbers into account.

The number in between and 77 and 83 should be 80, but we found 79. Also the higher we go the more exotic the numbers become. We have the standard 97, but you will see also 92, 95 and 98. When you study ranges long enough, let’s say a long (upside movement) range, you will see erratic price action at the range extreme. Some people call it search and destroy, or account killers. The inverse Goldbach numbers explain this behaviour.

\n--- Page 36 ---\nWHAT IS A DEALING RANGE A dealing range is a price range which we will use to trade within. This price range will be 100%, and this is where we will create Goldbach levels inside.  Inside this range, price will typically do a number of things: 
Consolidate: price will stay ﬂat, it will not move much higher or lower 
Move away: when price breaks out of the consolidation, it will expand away, either higher or lower, typically towards the high or low of the dealing range 
Retrace: typically price doesn’t move one sided way only. When price tries to reach the dealing range high or low, it will do so in a zigzag way. Let’s say price want to reach the dealing range high. It will expand by a certain percentage (let’s say 10%), and than retrace a little bit (let’s say 3%), to continue its path up towards the dealing range high 
Reverse: when price reaches the dealing range high or low, it typically reverses to go back inside the range again. Typically price will stay inside a certain dealing range for a period of time. When it reaches the high or low of the dealing range, it will potentially do a stop run (run an old high or low, and go back into the established range. When it doesn’t do this, it might go to a next dealing range, be it the dealing range above or below. FundamentalsPage  of 36195 2025.03

\n--- Page 38 ---\nEXPANSION AND CONTRACTION As you learn in the ﬁrst part, the PO3 number will play an important role in dealing ranges. Expansion and contraction is where our PO3 numbers come into play.  Expansion is when we go from a lower PO3 number to the next higher PO3 number.  For instance, we expand from PO3 number 27 towards PO3 number 81. On the other hand, when we do a contraction, we will move from a higher PO3 number towards a lower PO3 number. For instance, we contract from the PO3 number 729 towards PO3 number 243.

\n--- Page 39 ---\nPO3 DEALING RANGE A PO3 dealing range is utilising the PO3 numbers combined with the Goldbach levels inside them. Typically a PO3 dealing range is large enough to ﬁt all the Goldbach levels inside, and provide still enough room to trade those Goldbach levels as support and resistance. You want to see 2 or 3 reactions on the Goldbach levels for a given day. If you see more reactions on diﬀerent lines, your PO3 number is set to low. You want to do a PO3 expansion towards a larger PO3 number. On the other hand, when you only see 1 or maybe no reactions on the Goldbach levels, your PO3 number is set too large, and you want to do a range contraction towards a lowed PO3 number. To setup a PO3 dealing range, use a large enough PO3 number, deﬁne a ﬁb tool with the prime numbers deﬁned earlier in the book (the Goldbach partitions).

Remember, these Goldbach levels are the institutional levels, and deﬁne your support and resistance levels, or your supply and demand zones if you will. I would suggest to open a 1 Hour chart, and play with the PO3 dealing ranges (a PO3 number with Goldbach levels inside).

\n--- Page 41 ---\nPO3 TOO LOW On the Nasdaq chart, we choose the PO3 number 729 with Goldbach levels inside.  As you can see, there are multiple hits for a given day. Although the levels provide nice reactions - you can see price stops for a brief moment at a Goldbach levels, or even reverses at the levels - these are “too many lines”. For most people this will lead to analysis paralysis.  Will price reverse here, or will it continue. This happens too many time per day. 
You will need to do an expansion towards a higher number. This can be 1 PO3 number higher, or maybe 2 or even 3 PO3 numbers. FundamentalsPage  of 41195 2025.03

The PO3-1 number is a PO3 number lower (contraction) than your optimal PO3 number The PO3+1 is a PO3 number higher (expansion) than the optimal PO3 number. In our example the ODR (optimal PO3 dealing range) is 2187.  The PO3-1 will be 729, the PO3+1 will be the 6561.  You will see that sometimes a level on the PO3-1 or PO3+1 is being respected, while it just fell short on the ODR level. This will come with experience. You might want to plot the ODR and PO3+1 (in a diﬀerent color) on a chart, and monitor the PO3-1 on chart next to it. FundamentalsPage  of 43195 2025.03

The PO3 number of the PO3 dealing range should be large enough, else you end up again with “too many lines”. We will draw a new Goldbach ﬁb (the one you use inside the normal PO3 dealing range), but now in between 2 Goldbach levels of the main PO3 dealing range. Below’s chart is Bitcoin with a 177147 PO3 dealing range turned on. You can see current price action is sitting in between the 53 and 59 levels of the main 177147 PO3 dealing range.

\n--- Page 46 ---\nINTENDED DEALING RANGE CONCEPT This is a concept I use with new assets like Bitcoin for instance. Every asset has an intended dealing range. A range that will be used for years or even decades.  For mature assets, like currencies for instance, this intended dealing ranges was already determined years or decades ago. For new assets like bitcoin, they are still creating the intended dealing ranges, and there will be clues on what the ﬁnal intended dealing range will be. When the intended dealing ranges is established, it will trade inside this ranges for decades, and an expansion towards a higher intended dealing range is a very rare occurrence. Price will do range expansions over multiple years to ﬁnally end to the intended dealing range. Price will move from one PO3 number, trade inside this range, and ﬁnally break out the range, do a PO3 expansion, and will trade inside the larger range. It will do this a number of times, until the ﬁnal PO3 number is established. FundamentalsPage  of 46195 2025.03

The next chart shows how price moved outside the 243 PO3 dealing range, so range expansion dictates the next range is 729. You can see it trade to to 729 high, to reject and move back to the middle of the range. Only to brutally reject the middle and do another range expansion towards 2187.

Next they will do a expansion away from this block, and leave some kind of gap inside the third Goldbach block (the green shaded area from 11 -> 17). Price will continue upwards until they hit Goldbach block 5 or 6 (max the middle), and price will return towards Goldbach block 2 or 3. From there you will see a rapid expansion, potentially towards the PO3 dealing range high. Below screenshot is showcasing the 177147 PO3 dealing range.

As you can see, they are creating a large consolidation inside the second Goldbach block, and creating a gap inside the third Goldbach block, so it is likely the intended range will be 
531441. This technique doesn’t work only for the newer assets (like crypto for instance), but also for stocks for example.

\n--- Page 50 ---\nWhen you move from 1 PO3 number to the next one, it’s always good to keep an eye on another range as well. This range can be deﬁned as  (PO3+ next PO3)/2 So for example, when we move from the 81 towards the 243 range, we calculate the hidden range as: (81+243)/2 = 324/2 = 162 This accounts for 2 stacked 81 ranges. In below example we have Bitcoin. This moved from the 59049 range, so the next range is 177147.  But it’s always good to keep an eye on the (59049+177147)/2 = 118098 as well.

\n--- Page 55 ---\nFIXED OPTIMAL DEALING RANGE There are 2 variations you can use this.  The ﬁrst one is the original ODR, and is calculating the current range from base 0. So the start of price.  This is using ﬁxed partitions (they will be on the same place all the time.  Another variation, and this is the one I mainly use, is with a dynamic anchoring point. This point changes every day. To use the ﬁxed ODR, we need to ﬁnd a way to know where we are inside the IDR. Now, we will use PO3 partitions starting from base 0, so start at the 0 level.  This can be 0 for crypto, stocks, … or 0.0 for forex. In order to calculate the dealing range partition we’re currently in for our asset – be it fx, indices, crypto, … – we need to have following variables: 
current price 
the most optimal power of three number. Read the part on how to calculate the optimal PO3 dealing range, previously discussed in the book We’re going to draw a ﬁxed range, using 2 lines, which will delineate our optimal PO3 dealing range.   For the current price, we’re just going to open a chart, and take the price that’s currently printing. Now, we’re going to calculate the current PO3 dealing range low and high. For this, we take the current price, and remove the decimal point, if there is one.  FundamentalsPage  of 55195 2025.03

It will take only the integer number, and disregard the fractional part.  If we don’t do this, we will end up with the same number as we started with.

We add the 243 PO3 number to it, and we get a dealing range high of 12150+243 = 12393 dealing range high = dealing range low + po3 numberThe last step we need to do is to put back the decimal point, at the position it originally was, if the asset was forex related.  In our EURUSD example, the decimal point was after the ﬁrst position, so we get following dealing range low and high for our 243 PO3 range dealing range low  = 1.2150dealing range high = 1.2393

This time reference point is diﬀerent per asset, but it is based on the daily settlement of the asset. It is also know as the daily ﬁx price.  We will use this reference point to attach our Goldbach dealing range to it, and more speciﬁcally the middle of the Goldbach ﬁb.

\n--- Page 63 ---\nNORMAL PO3 STOP RUNS Power of three stop runs can come into 2 shapes.  Either it’s a real stop run of the buy - or sell side liquidity.  You’ll typically see a stop run of the liquidity resting under an old low or above an old high of 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 pips, depending on the time frame. Or price stops at a certain level, most likely a dealing range high or low, and will create a wick of a PO3 size, so a wick of 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 long. If this is the case, you now have a valid rejection block, and the open or close of the rejection block can be used to enter a trade. Later in this book you can read some additional information about PO3 stop runs. Have a look for the external range delimiter section. I like to see PO3 stop runs within a PO3 dealing range of the smaller number, like 3, 9, 27.  Certainly when there’s a short term high or low just resting under a Goldbach level.  This is something I heavily use in my personal trade plan.. For PO3 stop runs outside of the current size optimal dealing range, I like to see a stop run of that PO3 - 2 level. So let’s say we’re using a PO3 729 dealing range, I like to see a PO3 - 2 = 81 stop run. FundamentalsPage  of 63195 2025.03

\n--- Page 69 ---\nPO3 LIQUIDITY The Goldbach levels are basically areas of price where we will expect a reaction. Consider them your institutional levels, your support resistance, your supply/demand zones. Now, you will very often see that we run short of the Goldbach level, leaving liquidity.  I consider the Goldbach levels the “real” support and resistance levels, and expect price to at least hit them.  So when you see price stops a PO3 number (typically 3 or 9 pips/handles) short of a Goldbach level, expect we will see a PO3 stop run to clear this liquidity.  So we might have 3 pips liquidity short of a Goldbach level, and a 9 pip stop run into the Goldbach level to clear this liquidity. Liquidity comes in the form of: 
gaps of PO3 size 
Order blocks of PO3 size 
Stops under a short term swing low or above a short term swing high. The swing will be PO3 pips/handles short of a Goldbach level

Price drove back up, to later drive down, with a 9 pip PO3 stop run, into the Goldbach level, clearing out the 3 pip PO3 liquidity. So the paradigm here is:  1: We want to see a Goldbach level 2: that is not traded to yet, and a short term low or high is created above or below the level, of a certain PO3 size 3: and this liquidity is later run using a PO3 stop run

If price goes out of your dealing range 
And does a PO3 stop run regularly, (eg you have a 243 dealing range, with a 27 PO3 stop run) 
This can indicate 2 things. 
Either your dealing range is too small, and you need to recalculate the most optimal dealing range 
Or your dealing range is still in line with the optimal PO3 size, and price will move to the next partition 
If price is consolidating, will see often PO3 stop runs, and price goes back into the range

Each Goldbach level will tell you what to look for. Are you inside the OB range (3 -> 11 or 97 -> 89) you look for an order block to form.  In the breaker block zone? Look for a breaker to form. You either look at the left of the chart if price created the speciﬁc block in the past, or you wait for price to create one for you.  If you do not see the corresponding block to form in the zone you are in, you probably have not a valid block.  No order block in the OB zone? No trade using a nonexistent order block.

Goldbach levels are partitions of 2 primes that added together form an even number 
We use the number 100, as this is 100% of a range 
There can be more than 1 Goldbach partition for an even natural number 
We are looking for 7 Goldbach partitions, 1 for each price area.  
They come in pairs, so a premium and discount number 
This deﬁnes your market symmetry, balanced price, … 
We use the standards Goldbach numbers and also 2 other sets (with a premium and discount), we call the non Goldbach numbers 
“Order blocks” and gaps will form around the Goldbach numbers 
Non gb numbers will see imbalances formed around them, and there is one above and one below the liquidity void level 
Goldbach numbers are the basis for the 2 algorithms, which we determined using a tweaked Tesla Vortex, discussed in the Time and Price part of the book

\n--- Page 86 ---\nINTRODUCTION The look back partition is where the number 9 comes into play.  We just use a sequence of the number 9 to deﬁne our partitions that make up the look back anchor points, but we ignore the ﬁrst number 9. As to why we ignore the ﬁrst 9 (and another one later in the sequence), this will become clear in a moment. The sequence we will use is: 18-27-36-45-54-63-72-81-99-108-117-126 This sequence is to be used on the daily chart, and delineate the partitions.  We will break the numbers of the sequence in 2 parts: 
the ﬁrst digit in case the complete number < 100, else we take the ﬁrst 2 digits. This will make up the month 
The last digit. This will make up the day of that speciﬁc month

\n--- Page 87 ---\nWe will come up with following table 
The days of the speciﬁc month will make up our anchor points, so it’s best to open a daily chart, and draw 12 lines for the year, given the speciﬁc day for the month. Should a day fall on a weekend, you use the following trading day, typically Monday following the weekend.  If for example you need to draw the vertical line for May the 4th, but this day falls on a Saturday, you would draw a vertical line for Monday the 6th for that speciﬁc year.

\n--- Page 88 ---\nYou’ll now understand why we don’t use the numbers 09 and 90, as there is no Month 0 with a day 9, and there is no day 0 in the 9th month. Now we have deﬁned the partitions, marking up the look back partitions, it’s time to put them in action.  At the start of the new partition, we look for a clue based on the speciﬁc number of that partition.  For example, if we started the partition for the month of October, we will use the number 108. With this number (108 in this case), we will look for a stop run of 108 pips in any of the previous 3 partitions (the 20-40-60 look back).   What is also possible is that you don’t need to look for a stop run, but that you’ll ﬁnd a FVG of this amount of pips The last possibility is that there’s an order block in close proximity, with this size (108 for October). At the start of the new look back partition, you typically look for the ﬁrst few trading days of the new partition to hit either the liquidity, the fair value gap or the order block. Later in the book you will learn about Goldbach Time for a trading day, but we’re going to use something similar here. We expect price to aggressively trade away (reverse) from this point, and we expect a PO3 stop run on the opposite direction.  This PO3 stop run can be either a real liquidity stop run, or when you see a PO3 size wick, it’s possible this wick is used as a target.  FundamentalsPage  of 88195 2025.03

\n--- Page 90 ---\nHIPPO You’ll ﬁnd references to HIPPO in the following examples.  This is an “invention” of mine, to demonstrate that if you understand the Goldbach price levels, you can create any trading system around it, give a concept a name of your liking.  That’s why I came up with the HIPPO: H: HIDDEN I : INTERBANK P: PRICE P: POINT O: OBJECTIVE Basically, a HIPPO is a “hidden” order block, where you take the wicks of 2 consecutive bars.  You do not take any 2 bars, but the bars should create a fair value gap.

Above you can see 2 green candles. The second candle didn’t ﬁll in the ﬁrst gap, and the next candle (the red indecision candle) also formed a gap.  When we attach the top of the wick of the ﬁrst candle to the bottom of the wick of the second candle, you can see a “hidden” order block forming.  You can also see that this HIPPO oﬀered support later on (and also closed the top FVG.

\n--- Page 92 ---\nWhen studying HIPPO’s you will often ﬁnd that they are created: 
around CE levels. This will give a good indication a CE level will hold in the future, or it will be re-used later on 
Around the non Goldbach levels. Remember, non Goldbach levels are created to “split” the liquidity void zone into 6% blocks.  So there will be a non Goldbach level above, and one below the liquidity void level (71/29). Typically you will also see HIPPO’s form around these levels. An even more interesting observation you will make is that these (potentially) 2 HIPPO’s will be the trigger for a break away gap and a measuring gap. This is also the area where imbalances will occur.

\n--- Page 93 ---\nHIPPO’s are just like order blocks, they can be reclaimed in the future, or they can act as a reverse HIPPO, just like when an order block becomes a mitigation block, when it is traded through. In below example you can see a HIPPO, which was ﬁrst traded to, to create the high.  But later, when price was traded down, and went straight through the HIPPO (both fair value gaps were breached), price retraced back up, into the HIPPO sensitive point, which is where the close of the ﬁrst candle matches the open of the next candle that make up the HIPPO.

\n--- Page 94 ---\nGOLDBACH TIME IN LOOK BACK PARTITIONS Later in the book you will learn about Goldbach Time for a given trading day, but we’re going to use something similar here. You learned that you are looking for clues that price will be supported be the look back partition number. And that this should happen the ﬁrst couple of days after the partition starts. We understand the partitions are build using the number 9. Now, where does Goldbach come into play here? We will be looking for the number 11, a Goldbach number.  We want to look for the day in a given month that - when we add the day number and the month number together - we get the number 11.  For instance, January is month 1, we need to add 10 to get 11, so although the look back partition for January starts on January 8th, we expect the clue to hit on January 10th. When we count the look back day as Day 1, this will be the third bar (Goldbach number 3) when the look back partition starts. We expect the stop run to occur when we reach day 11, or day 17. Also both Goldbach numbers. FundamentalsPage  of 94195 2025.03

\n--- Page 95 ---\nOne way to identify the key level is to use following technique: You take the open price of last month’s look back day. So for instance, on March 6th, you take the open price of February 7th. Now, we will draw a new Goldbach ﬁb based on the opening price, and we will add 10% and subtract 10% from this opening price. This will give you a range high and low, and these will provide critical levels which can be used for the look back period. 
In the above screenshot, prices are “cast forwarded” by 1 month. So we will use last month’s price action for the current look back month.  Tomorrow’s news, today so to speak. FundamentalsPage  of 95195 2025.03

\n--- Page 96 ---\nUsing Goldbach time, as a reminder, we will look 3 days after the look back window open for a high or low to form. This 3rd day should be a Goldbach number ideally, or a CE level.  So in below example, a low was formed at March 11th, so 3+11 = 14 = CE level. 
11 to 17 days later you look for an opposite swing, preferably with a stop run on liquidity.

This is however a weekend day, so we will take the ﬁrst Monday following this day, so we arrive at January the 10th.  We are still looking for either gaps or stop runs of 18 pips just when the new partition starts. 4 trading days into the new partition, we can see a 18 pip gap residing 2 partitions ago (40 day look back) When we hit this level, price breaks down, and it does a 81 PO3 stop run, triggering the reversal in price.

You can also witness the 54 pip gap below the HIPPO, so the HIPPO is made out of 2 54 pip gaps.  When the HIPPO triggered the sell oﬀ, we did a 81 PO3 stop run, where price reversed and headed to another 54 pip gap in the previous partition.

Calculate the year range by starting at the number 18 
Add 9 each time until you reach 126 
Number 90 will be skipped 
These number represent 2 things 
1: The Month + day a look back partition starts 
2: The number you will need to use for this look back partition 
This is a longer term view, i.e. a month, and we can look back multiple months (preferable maximum 3) 
You can use this technique for position trades 
It will deﬁne your bias for the current month 
Step 1: You deﬁne your start and end of the partition, eg. March 6th 
If this days falls on a weekend, take next Monday 
You can use AMD cycles in this range 
Step 2: you know the number for the month, you deﬁned this on the ﬁrst bullet points 
Using this number, you will look for clues, in the beginning of the partition (or the A cycle) 
Clues are: gaps, order blocks, wicks, liquidity runs, HIPPO’s  of this number 
This will be your trade entry point 
Step 3: We look for an opposite PO3 stop run. So not using the number of the month, but a 3, 9, 27, 81, … stop run 
This can happen either in the look back partition M cycle, or the fractal M cycle of the main D cycle

This represents your Accumulation, Manipulation and Distribution cycle

\n--- Page 127 ---\nWhen we take our beloved PO3 numbers, and consider 1 trading year, we exactly end up with what ICT always hinted:  
There are roughly 52 trading weeks in a year, with 5 trading days per week (forget about crypto here).  This accounts for 260 trading days per year.  But we are interested in PO3 numbers, so this gives us 260 - 243 = 1717 days is pretty much the amount of trading days of December, and we learned from the tweet that December “resets” the trading range.  This will give us for the yearly AMD range: Accumulation: January to April (the left big circle) Manipulation: April to May (the inner - smaller - circle) Distribution: May to November (the right big circle) Now, when you look closely, you can see that each circle is made up out of 3 other AMD circles.

\n--- Page 128 ---\nSo each of the 3 circles which make up the AMD phase, has their own AMD cycle in it. Read more about this in the Fractal chapter. We can do the same like we did above to layout the yearly expectations, but now for a given day. Below is information for forex (and crypto) related settlement. This is using concepts from the CLS settlement window, and the timings are in CET, as this is the timeframe CLS operates in.  For indices, I’m currently monitoring 18:45-18:45 EST, but this book will be updated with the correct information in due time. We are using the CLS timings for this, so a true day goes from 20:00-20:00 CET, which is 19:00-19:00 BST or 14:00-14:00 EST

\n--- Page 131 ---\nNow, I told you that we can break each phase into smaller AMD phases, as price is fractal.  So if we look for instance at the manipulation phase of the above screenshot, we can ﬁne tune it using the smaller AMD cycle  
You can see the accumulation phase, this is violated (market structure shift) and retraced back into (to form an OTE).  After the retrace into the consolidation of the accumulation phase, we expand into a pool of interest (liquidity, fvg, …) At this moment, we will reverse price. You will see that the reversal will typically be in the middle of the distribution cycle.

This is your typical Asian range, and we’re looking what they’re up to. Next, in the Mark phase, this is where I want to enter the market. This is where my focus is, and I want to enter here typically. This is the London Open session.  As explained, I want to get in at the middle of the manipulation phase, but I’m ﬂexible. We will learn about distortion of time in the next part, so no big deal if we do a stop run into a Goldbach level by the end of the manipulation cycle. The last phase is the delivering cycle, where we need to deal with the position we took during the manipulation cycle. Like you know, this is typically delivered in 2 phases, and we are cautious for potential reversals here, in line with either a reversal day, or a London close day to get back into the range.

\n--- Page 136 ---\nDISTORTION OF TIME My favourite setups occur during the Manipulation cycle. This can either be the main M cycle (London Open), or one of the fractal AMD cycles.  I want to see the PO3 stop run happen in the middle of the M cycle. This should hit (or just pass) a Goldbach level (so a run into the institutional level). All of this with a PO3 size run, like we learned.  If this run however fails to run into a Goldbach level, but this happens either in the beginning, or towards the end of the M cycle, I consider this as distortion of time.

One of the new ideas in town is candle counting. Now why does this work, you ask? When we take a time range, and we use the daily chart here, and we draw an AMD cycle in between the look back partition (you can see 2 partitions here), you will see that the AMD cycles generally align with the: 7 for the end of the A cycle 13 for the end of the M cycle 21 for the end of the D cycle FundamentalsPage  of 137195 2025.03

We have 3 main cycles inside a year, or a month 
For the year we take the PO3 number, so a year consists out of 243 trading days (roughly 52 weeks * 5 trading days) 
The remainder of the total trading days - 243 = December yearly range reset 
To use it for the day, we start at 20:00-20:00 CET, or 14:00-14:00 EST 
Also for the day there are 3 main sessions A = Asian Range M = London Open D = New York 
The D cycle can be divided in 2 cycles, D1 and D2 We are wary for reversals in D2, or in D1 if the M cycle was large 
Each main AMD cycle can be divided into a fractal AMD cycle, and once more (so 3 fractals) 
Preferably we look for a M cycle to create a high or low for the day, and this exactly in the middle 
We want to see in this M cycle, a PO3 stop run into a Goldbach level 
This can be either in the ﬁrst 1/3 or the last 1/3 of the M cycle, this will be considered distortion of time 
In the fractal M cycle, look either for PO3 stop runs in line with the daily order ﬂow 
Or look for reversals, mainly in the D2 cycle, or after a large main M cycle FundamentalsPage  of 139195 2025.03

If you don’t get a ﬁrm grasp of how PO3 dealing ranges work, how to use the Goldbach levels inside these, and witnessed the reaction points during the M cycle, it’s is too early to start using the algorithms. Now that the warning is out of the way, let’s talk about the 2 algorithms that we can see when we use a modiﬁed Tesla Vortex.  We understand Goldbach levels now, but how do we get to the 2 Goldbach algorithms you wonder?  Well, we are going to use a Tesla Vortex, but we base the calculation of our modular multiplication on the numbers we discovered here in this book. We understand that price action delivers using PO3 numbers (the number 3), and Goldbach levels.  We also identiﬁed the 14 diﬀerent Goldbach levels, which are the lines that make up the 7 Goldbach partitions of the number 100 (our full dealing range in percentages) So we will feed this in our vortex calculator: Modulus: 14Multiplier: 3

\n--- Page 148 ---\nNow we understand how we need to create the dealing ranges (using the PO3 numbers), and we understand the levels inside these dealing ranges (using Goldbach), and we understand that price is oﬀered by any of the 2 algorithms, we can get to work.  In the below screenshot, we identiﬁed for the EURUSD chart, the current 729 PO3 partition.  This partition runs from 1.0206 towards 1.0935, or the 14th 729 partition from base 0.0  14*729=10206 (dealing range low)10206 + 729 = 10935 (dealing range high)-> add decimal point for EURUSDWhen we put the range low and range high in our calculator, and we specify this is a 729 range, we can calculate the path using the Goldbach levels.

\n--- Page 149 ---\nYou can see in the screenshot that an order block was created, a fair value accompanied by it, price returned into the OB+FVG, price expanded away above equilibrium, price retraced back and was mitigated around equilibrium. We consolidated a little while, and price was aggressively expanded into the predeﬁned level to form the high of the algo, which is the premium fair value gap. To get a cleaner chart, you can ﬁlter out all the Goldbach levels that are not needed for the ﬂow of the speciﬁc algorithm. While we’re generally not calling tops and bottoms, using the po3 dealing ranges, Goldbach levels and the algorithm ﬂow, together with conﬂuences of what you’re about to learn with the look back partitions, it might reaﬃrm a change in direction

\n--- Page 150 ---\nSometimes when we are at the start (high or low) of a dealing range, it’s not clear what algo is forming.  A top tip here is to look at the past price action, to see where price comes from.  You look at the levels an algo makes up, and see if there was reaction from any of the levels to look for clues what algo will form.  
Take for instance above screenshot. At ﬁrst, it’s unclear if algorithm 1 or algorithm 2 is in play. The clue here is to wait and see what algorithm will form.  You can later see that an algorithm 2 was forming, as price moved from the rejection zone to create a rejection block. From there on, you see the rejection being respected, and a retrace into the fair value zone, where you enter. Always take something oﬀ at the equilibrium. If an algorithm fails, it will probably be at the equilibrium. Nothing wrong with taking a good chunks out of the markets, and re-evaluate. There might be a diﬀerent algorithm running on a higher or lower timeframe. FundamentalsPage  of 150195 2025.03

So, how do we put this into practice? Well, I have you covered. We’re going to use my personal trading model, which is actually a MMxM.   For those of you who didn’t know, I started to use the MMxM description back in the old days on the forum, but it’s widely used now. MMxM stands for: 
MMSM: Market maker Sell Model 
MMBM: Market maker Buy Model What we are going to use here are: 
2 Goldbach levels, preferably from a larger PO3 range, like 243 for instance 
A PO3 stop run into a Goldbach level, this during one of the manipulation cycles, either the main one, or a fractal one 
A breakdown from this Goldbach level, creating 2 PO3 sized gaps that make up the HIPPO

\n--- Page 154 ---\n Above is the anatomy of a Market maker sell model, for EURUSD, January 26th 2023. The Goldbach levels you see here are based on the 243 PO3 dealing range. You can see the OTE play out here. We can break this down into following ﬂow: 
stop run into a gb level 
break down, creating 2 PO3 3 pip gaps with a HIPPO 
Market structure shift at CE in between the gb levels, we didn't need to look for it ourself, the gb + CE did this for us 
touch of the gb level - start of the MMSM 
accumulate at the OB + FVG discount level 
SMR in the FVG premium level 
2 phases of distribution, at the gaps deﬁned by the HIPPO 
aggressive sell oﬀ to target sell side liquidity, to complete MMSM What I like to see is that the PO3 stop run (of 3 pips in this example) occurs during a manipulation phase. This can either FundamentalsPage  of 154195 2025.03
Sold to
benjamin.tunaru@gmail.com
\n--- Page 155 ---\nbe the main M phase (London Kill Zone), or a fractal M phase (in the New York kill zone for instance). We want to see an aggressive sell oﬀ, and break the consequent encroachment that exists between 2 levels, preferable between the fair value gap Goldbach level (17/83)m and the liquidity void level (29/71) A HIPPO will form at the start of this sell oﬀ, and it will create 2 PO3 sized gaps around it.  The bottom (or top for a MMBM) will be the trigger to look for your MMxM, and is the initial consolidation of the model. This will be your baseline that triggers the algorithm, and from the algorithm teachings earlier in the book we understand that algorithm 1 need to start at the high or low Goldbach level, which is 0 and 100.  The next level of algorithm 1 will be the order block level (11/89), and typically you will see an order block form in between these levels.  We will move to the (premium in case of a MMSM) breaker level (41/59), and the algorithm will typically seek to want to come back to the discount liquidity void level (71/29) Price next expands to the rejection block, where the smart money reversal occurs, and the right side begins. You will than see 2 levels of distributions, around the 2 PO3 sized gaps that formed the HIPPO. The second distribution will trigger an aggressive sell oﬀ, to complete the MMxM.

Now, this will reveal the wireframe we use to map the algorithm 1, and also explains the green box where it says “FAIR VALUE = OTE” in the previous screenshot. One will note that these ranges are no PO3 sized ranges, but rather 6% (standard Goldbach distance) or 8%( for the order block) of a PO3 dealing range.

\n--- Page 158 ---\nGOLDBACH TIME At ﬁrst, when you look at the charts, you will see what appears to be random swing points.  But did you know there’s a rhythm here too?  Enter Goldbach time. When you closely look at the swing point, and examine the time it occurs, we can see an interesting phenomenon.  If you add the minutes to the hour of a swing high or low, you will see that they occur at a Goldbach number. So you’re interested in all the numbers that make up the Goldbach partitions: 3,11,17,29,41,47,53,59,71,83,89 and 97 + non gb numbers 35,65,23,77 For example: A swing low occurs at 09:02. When we add 02 to 09, we get 11, which is a Goldbach number, or a Goldbach Time. When the next swing low occurs at 10:07, which is 07 + 10 = 17, this is also a Goldbach Time. It’s good to note that we are a little bit ﬂexible here. We might be oﬀ with 1 minute.  When you see a swing form - which is a 3 bar pattern - it can occur that the left OR right candle of the swing is at the Goldbach Time number. You will also often see that - when the swing rejects a Goldbach Price level - price will create an OTE. This OTE will also be formed at a Goldbach Time number. This will also help you in determine the daily bias. If swing highs occur, but not at a Goldbach time, but the swing lows occur at Goldbach times, it’s probably an up day.

Also it’s good to know we use the time in HH24 format, so it’s not 1PM but rather 13.

\n--- Page 160 ---\nNow that we have the Goldbach Price levels, the Goldbach Time levels, and understand how to use these to determine the bias, we can combine everything together. 
In the image you can see that Swing highs occur at Goldbach Price levels. The swing lows do not occur at Goldbach Time levels, so our bias for the day is short.  We can also see that - although we create swing highs at the Goldbach Time levels - they do not occur at a Goldbach Price level. What does this mean? Well, this means we will probably see a deeper retracement, until we hit a Goldbach Price level at a Goldbach Time level. Good to note is also that - just like in Goldbach Price - we also have the concept of a Mean Threshold.  So if you see price touch a Mean Threshold level, it might very well be at a Goldbach Time Mean Threshold. In the above example you can see price touched a MT of the OB at 10:10 = 20, or the MT between 17 and 23.  FundamentalsPage  of 160195 2025.03

\n--- Page 161 ---\nAnd this is your real grid, where Goldbach Time meets Goldbach Price. We can see a strong rejection from the Goldbach Price level at the Goldbach Time level. Now, this can also help us in identifying potential order ﬂow reversals.  In the example we are short, as all swing highs were created at a Goldbach Time, while the swing lows were not. But if you suddenly see swing highs are out-of-sync with Goldbach Time, and swing lows are respecting Goldbach Times, it’s very likely bias was changed, and you should be very nimble with shorts.  
This will also help you in identifying the potential Judas swing for the day or session. FundamentalsPage  of 161195 2025.03

\n--- Page 169 ---\nThe protocol for this model - which happens mostly on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday is the following, and based all on PO3 numbers. You will need to calculate the optimal PO3 number here (check the previous paragraph in the book, or use the auto function of dmn’s indicator). Let’s say we use 243 in this example. We are going to have the following numbers in mind: PO3: which is 243, and matches the average weekly range. PO3 - 1: which is 81, and matches the average daily range. PO3 - 2: which is 27, and matches the stop run we are looking for. PO3 - 3/4: which is 9 and 3, which is the liquidity we look for. As a reminder, this can be a block or gap formed around Goldbach levels, or liquidity in the form of stop under/above a short term low or high. Now, to put this plan in place, we’re going to use the PO3 or PO3-1 number to set the dealing range and Goldbach levels inside. This means we use either the average weekly or daily  range, mapped to PO3 numbers. I like the weekly range levels, and will target the daily range levels, so this means I like to take a good chunk from the PO3-1 range, or 24 pips in this plan. Next, you will look for a PO3-3 consolidation. This happens for forex during the night (CLS, so in CE(s)T time), or for US indices, during the night in US (18:00 EST/EDT). Next phase is to look for a fake move outside this consolidation. This will mostly be a PO3-3/4 number, so 3 or 9 pips in this case.  This fake move will be rejected immediately, and price will purge through the PO3-3 consolidation. FundamentalsPage  of 169195 2025.03

\n--- Page 170 ---\nIt will retrace brieﬂy, and touch the consolidation again. When we see this pattern happening, we are going to hone our anticipation skills, and look for the PO3-2 stop run (27 pips) to occur, and clear the PO3 liquidity. The last phase is to enter the trade.  Either you’re going to trust the Goldbach levels, and enter right at the stop run level. Or you’re going to wait for conﬁrmation. Price will reject the Goldbach levels, and retrace. It will do this once more, and this is where you enter. So to conclude, we can summarise this: We’re going to take a trade based on the average weekly range PO3 number (243), to take a portion out of the average daily range PO3 number (81). We are looking for a PO3 consolidation (9), and look for clues for a good PO3 stop run (27). This stop run targets PO3 liquidity (3 or 9 gap, block, stops). We enter at the touch of the Goldbach level, or after a conﬁrmation.

\n--- Page 171 ---\nYou learned in the Goldbach chapter that the daily candles’ wicks and bodies are also Goldbach number in most cases. We can use this to our advantage to see if the stop run and Goldbach level we anticipate to hold, matches with a Goldbach daily projection.  We measure from the asset open time (check the chapter for the times), draw a price projection, and this should form a Goldbach number (in percentages), and it should closely align with the PO3 stop run level, and PO3 liquidity. In this case, the price projection was 0.17%, and aligned with the low we identiﬁed by the stop run and liquidity.

When price rejects the Goldbach level, and retrace, you will see that the Goldbach level it rejected, and the wick it creates during a retracement can be aligned to the 0/100 and 3/97 Goldbach levels.  You should see a block form in between the 3-11/97/89 levels and a gap in between the 11-17/89-83 level. This will reinforce our trade idea. This new (non PO3 sized) range, will give you reference points for where you can take partials of your trade. The trade is expected to the other side in ideal circumstances.

Gb levels needed: 59/71/100/111 or 41/29/0/-0.111 
You want to see price come oﬀ from the high/low or just miss this level, so failed to touch the HL 
You want to see a breaker to be formed in the breaker zone (59-71 or 29-41) 
Price will expand away from the breaker to target buy side liquidity (short) or sell side liquidity (long), It should stop at, or close to, the PO3 dealing range stop run level 
Price will then reject, and raid a short term low or high 
When price retraces back, it should stop at the partition extreme (high/low), this is where you enter. Stop should be below/above the PO3 stop run level 
Your take proﬁt is at the liquidity void level (71/29) for 24 pips in a 81 pips DR 
You monitor if the breaker will become a “real” breaker  FundamentalsPage  of 176195 2025.03

\n--- Page 177 ---\nGB: THE EQUILIBRIUM TRADE PLAN USE THE MITIGATION BLOCK AND EQUILIBRIUM 
Price is hovering around the equilibrium levels (47/53) 
There are clear buy and sell stops between the equilibrium and mitigation block levels (47/53) 
When price hit one of the mitigation levels (47/53) you enter 
You exit at the opposite mitigation level for 14 pips in a 81 pip DR

\n--- Page 178 ---\nGB: THE FVG TRADE PLAN USE THE FVG AND PROPULSION BLOCK 
Gb levels: 0/100, 11/89 (Order block), 17/83 (fvg), 41/59 (Breaker) 
Price will create an order block (can include the fvg zone as well), into the High/Low 
Price will move away, out of the order block and fvg zone, and returns back into the fvg zone 
It will create a propulsion block inside the fvg zone (but can go as high as the mean threshold of the order block zone). 
When price breaks the propulsion block (buy/sell on stop), it will aggressively reprice lower/higher, into the breaker zone 
It will leave a liquidity void, which will later be traded too FundamentalsPage  of 178195 2025.03

\n--- Page 179 ---\nGB: THE EINSTEIN TRADE PLAN USE THE OB, L V AND FVG Ever wondered why you see following names being used on the internet to identify middle of things? 
Equilibrium: middle of a range 
Mean Threshold: middle of an order block 
Consequent Encroachment: middle of a gap When you put the bold letters together you get: E = M (Times) C (Exponentiation) Or e=mc2 Or energy = mass times speed of light times 2 We want to see energetic moves, starting from the the consolidation. You want to see speed, creating FVG. If we consider the speed of light - namely 299 792 458 - group this large number into 3 times 3 digits, we get following numbers. These numbers can be divided by our PO3 number 27 (and we round them down), to get the levels we’re interested in. 299 / 27 = 11 = Order block level 792 / 27 = 29 = liquidity void level 458 / 27 = 17 = fair value level FundamentalsPage  of 179195 2025.03

\n--- Page 180 ---\nSo to use this plan you want to see: 
Ideally an order block form inside the order block zone 
From the OB level (11/89), you want price to expand away, and create a break away gap. 
Price should reverse at the liquidity void level (29/71) 
And retrace into the FVG level (17/83). 
The mean consequent encroachment (middle) of the FVG block should hold here. 
Target - as this is speed of light exponentiation should be the mitigation block level (47/53). Reason for this is the distance between 11->29 = 18 long. We double this from level 29, and we arrive at 47.

\n--- Page 183 ---\nPO3 DR SHIFTING Sometimes it’s useful to do half shifting of a PO3 dealing range. Certainly when you compare 2 assets with the same PO3 DR, where 1 asset appears to be at the top/bottom of the range, while the other is in de the middle of the same size PO3 range.  When you 1/2 shift the “lagging” asset, things get aligned between the 2 assets, and you will see (Goldbach) SMT much clearer this way. Here is the image with the non shifted PO3 DR on it. As you can see price is hovering around the middle of the range.  At the same time, EURUSD was at the top of its dealing range.

\n--- Page 186 ---\nRISK MANAGEMENT  Most aspiring traders want to be all over the place, trading every asset possible, with all trading plans provided here in the book.  However, and certainly in trading, less is more.  Using asymmetric compounding you only need to have 3 winning trades to pass a standard prop trading channel.  If we use my personal trade plan, which has a 10 pip stop loss and a 24 pip take proﬁt, so a 2.4 RR, it only requires a risk of a quarter of a percent - yes 0.25% - of your initial balance to pass the challenge. Let’s assume a balance of 5000 USD Trade 1: We risk 12.5 USD (0.25% of the initial balance) to make 30 USD Trade 2: We risk again 12.5 USD (0.25% of the initial balance) but we will add the 30 USD we earned, so our risk will be 42.5 USD, to make 102 USD Trade 3: Now we will be risk free, and only use the money we made with trade 1 and trade 2, or 30 + 102 USD = 132 USD This trade will return 316.8 USD on successful completion. So we made - if we have 3 consecutive winning trades - 30 + 102 + 316.8 = 448.8, or 8.9%. Most prop ﬁrms have a requirement for phase 1 of 8%, so we should be good.

What people earn in a day in one country, is someone else weekly or even monthly pay in another region. That’s why we enabled Purchasing Power Parity on the platform we use (Gumroad) to calibrate the prices to what is deemed fair in your region. Some regions get up to 90% oﬀ of the oﬃcial price, just to keep things fair. Some people paid 50% of the price of the original book on unoﬃcial sites, groups, … It might very well be that if you would have bought from our oﬃcial site, it would cost less than the amount you paid for a bootlegged version.
